# A simple calendar [IMPORtANT, READ ME!]



## Description
  
  This is my very first (non-mini) personal project aims to deliver a calendar web-app, brush up on my coding skills, and help me understand front-end concepts. This project heavily emphasize on vanilla Html, CSS and JavaScript, and it does NOT belongs to any tutorials or lecture series. I am trying to design every functionality and solve every problems by myself.
  
## Current Status

  This project is now terminated, as I realized the project is getting terribly unmanageable when it is growing bigger and bigger, if I still insist on the idea that 99% of the code has to be hand-coded. Even though this project has been ended early, it doesn't mean that it is totally meaningless. I have learnt a lot in just 14 days (From the start of this project to its end), including:
  
  - Express.js Framework
  - The structure of a database and SQL
  - The usage of Node.js and its concepts
  - JWT Tokens
  - git operations
  - Setting up a backend server
  - And the most important skill, learn from reading documentations

## Expected features

- An interactive calendar
- Login system
- JWT Tokens for login persistence
- Data synced from MariaDB
- Sharing events between users
- Exporting calendar events to .ics file
